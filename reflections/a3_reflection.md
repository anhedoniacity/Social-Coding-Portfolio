- I couldn’t figure out how to get pandas to read in the csv, so I tried defining it as a function. It still did not work. I finally realized I needed to paste the whole file path into the pd.read_csv function.
- in number 4, I decided to present the ratio as percentages out of 100, which is likely to be more comprehensible to the average layman reader. I put the decimal percentage out of one in parentheses.
- in number 5, #voyages_df.info() is the simple way to get the null values, but I made things harder for myself because I only wanted the values for the three columns I was working with without the other clutter. However, I didn’t feel like making things even harder than that, so instead of defining a function to subtract non-nulls from totals for a given column, I did that part manually.
- the only acceptable type of data visualization for number 9 is, in my opinion, a bar graph. while pie charts are also effective for visualizing   data in qualitative categories, using one here would falsely imply that the total chart showed 100% of slave voyages, and therefore that the five most prolific slaveship captains were actually the *only* five slaveship captains.
