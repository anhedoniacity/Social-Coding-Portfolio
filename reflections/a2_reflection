2024-11-16 Extremely unfun fact: I wrote more than 1,000 words for this reflection while I was completing activity 2, and while I am almost certain I committed and posted it on Monday night, I couldn't find it anywhere when I looked for it today. This immediately made me have a severe autistic meltdown-panic attack combo, so I am rewriting this with severely shaking hands and my entire face swollen just to say that it won't be back for a while at least, possibly ever. Sorry Zach.
