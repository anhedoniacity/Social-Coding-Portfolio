- I made one billion syntax errors while working on this. oops
- I had a huge amount of trouble with the "name" step, because I tried using the string.join function (hard mode) in addition to + symbols (easy mode) to combine first and last. (I erroneously assumed Zach wanted us to use string.join because it comes up on the Melanie Walsh page associated with this activityâ€” I was wrong and he just wanted + symbols oops x2) string.join repeatedly printed my name last first instead of first last, which I couldn't figure out how to fix until Zach told me Python reads string lists from right to left. My original solution of reversing the list was apparently right all along
- For the user input activity, I made the world's most low-effort high or low game using if statements. I borrowed
geeksforgeeks.org's explanation of using random.choice for RNG and Rozco(https://github.com/Rozcowork)'s first line for user_input because I didn't previously know the syntax for user variables, so I must thank both.
